# KEGGexpressionmapper

(still under construction...)

This is a R workbench, that can be used to visualise the expression or the abundancy
of proteomics data for particular KEGG pathway, or even the entire pathway set.

The script can be started by invoking
> KEGGExpressionsmapper

Then, the KEGG pathway after another is downloaded from the KEGG website and is then
replacing the pathway illustration by the color-information expression or abundance.

Finally, the expression and abundance informed pathways, as well as the enriched pathways containing
more genes than expected can be downloaded and further manually assessed.
