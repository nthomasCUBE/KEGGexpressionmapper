# KEGGexpressionMapper v0.1

The KEGGexpressionMapper is a R package, that allows to visualize the expression of genes or can illustrate the abundances of proteins. 

## How to run it

It can be started by invoking the method “KEGGexpressionMapper(expression_mapping_file, kegg_to_gene_mapping_file, gene_candidate_file).

## Parameter explaination

### Expression_Mapping_file
Parameter: Expression_Mapping_file contains the genes in the first row, following by the expression of each conditions. The values per conditions are seperated by a “,”.

### Kegg_to_gene_mapping_file
Parameter: Kegg_to_gene_mapping_file contains the mapping of genes to the KEGG orthologous.

### Gene_candidate_file 
Parameter: gene_candidate_file contains the genes, that should be highlighted in the expression-informed visualisation.
